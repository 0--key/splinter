Firefox WebDriver

Firefox WebDriver is provided by Selenium 2.0. To use it, you need to install Selenium 2.0 via pip:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ [sudo] pip install selenium

It's important to note that you also need to have `Firefox <http://firefox.com>`_ installed in your machine.
Once you have it installed, there is nothing you have to do, just use it :)
